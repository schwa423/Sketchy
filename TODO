BEFORE NEXT COMMIT:

More unit-testing:
- job::impl::Queue
- job::JobId.  Since JobPool is a friend, make a mock version in the test file.
- job::JobPool.  Is general coverage sufficient?  Also, thread-safety.
- job::Queue

- benchmarked job overhead at about 40us/job on iPad 2.  Not bad for no profiling/optimization, but 10us would be nicer.

- find way to avoid making JobData be or contain a union.  Tricky.  For one thing, it would probably require pushing the union down into Job,
  with the following implications:
  - could not implement using a Kernel trampoline, since the Kernel does not have access to the Job itself.
  - would need another variant of JobPool::obtain() which takes a KernelLambda as an argument.

- test yield()   (wait... is it even implemented yet?)

- add worker-priority to Boss (all workers answering to a Boss have the same thread-priority).

- General cleanup of job.h/cpp.  Document them.

- API to determine number of CPUs at runtime  (see NUM_CPUS in sketchy.cpp)

- Apache License v2.0 yo!  (plus NOTICE file)




OLDER (STILL VALID?)

- fix the shadowing of _renderer in PageView.
- clean up VAO upon destruction of StrokeMesh.
- glBindVertexArrayOES(0) necessary after draw?
- make tesselate() a static function of Arc, move into schwa::
- class comments for Uniform.
