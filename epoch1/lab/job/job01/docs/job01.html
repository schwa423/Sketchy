Usage:

JobBoss boss;


typedef impl::PriorityJobQueue<3> JobQueue;


Boss<JobQueue> boss;

JobQueue& q = boss.GetQueue();

Job j = q.spawn(FooJobDesc(arg1, arg2, arg3));

Job j2 = j.spawn(FooChildJobDesc(arg1));


JobDescription::Run(Job& j, JobQueue& q) {
	
	// Whatever we want!
}


 

Future<FooChildJobDesc::ResultType>???






Points to elaborate on:

==== responsiveness:
     - scheduling should support breaking large jobs into small pieces (low-latency, prioritization)


==== instrumentibility
     - template metaprogramming for flexible, low-overhead instrumentation
     - eg: decorate some or all JobDescriptions with a template wrapper
         - all jobs of a specified type
         - every 10th job

<h1> module <a href="../../schwa.html">ǝ</a>::job01 </h1>

<p> ǝ::job01 is the first version of ǝ's new job-scheduler, which the ambitious goal of evolving into a groundbreaking interactive system for controlling and integrating all available computational resources (CPU/GPU/disk/network/co-processor/sensors/etc).</p>

<p> This version focuses on low-overhead, low-latency scheduling of CPU resources on mobile multicore platforms.  Here are the main design goals, and a few words about each:
	<ul>
	<li> efficiency: minimize scheduling overhead to maximize actual work done, and make efficient use of the memory hierarchy.</li>
	<li> responsiveness: jobs cooperatively run for short time slices, so the system can quickly adapt to priority changes.</li>
	<li> simplicity: a few powerful abstractions allow the system to be small but powerfully expressive.</li>
	<li> instrumentibility: use template metaprogramming to control the recording of various performance statistics, for example by decorating the job-description class.</li>
		<ul>
		<li> record stats (slice-time, total-time, job-type, priority level, etc). of every 10th job.</li>
		<li> record stats for every job of some type (or set of types).</li>
		<li> supports unit-tests and automated performance tests.</li>
		<li> provide empirical support for architectural decisions.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> "scalability" <b>(better name?)</b>: complimentary to "simplicity"... well-designed abstractions naturally support a wide range of use-cases:
		<ul>
		<li> async I/O </li>	
		<li> spliting up large, embarassingly parallel jobs</li>
		<li> long-lived Jobs (eg: lifetime of a Croquet Island or Dart Isolate)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h1> a note on submodules </h1>
<p> ǝ::job01 has a number of submodules:
	<ul>
	<li> ǝ::job01::core </li>
	<li> ǝ::job01::host </li>
	<li> ǝ::job01::mem </li>
	<li> ǝ::job01::time </li>
	</ul>
	The natural position of these modules would be next to ǝ::job01, for example ǝ::core00.  However, that would suggest a level of general usability that I'm not aiming for yet (with the exception of the public ǝ::job API).  Therefore, I make them submodules of ǝ::job01, and concern myself with only two goals:
	<br> -=-=-=-= minimum necessary to support ǝ::job well (this makes it easier to properly adapt when new use-cases arrive )
	<br> -=-=-=-= learning experience for when it is time to do the "real" versions of those submodules
