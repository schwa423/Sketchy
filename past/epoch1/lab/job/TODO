some more stuff



===============================================================================
== features ===================================================================

Pass Jobs between (aspects of the same) Queues/Pools in different Workers
- need help of Bookkeeper (Accountant)
_______________________________________________________________________________

Job-duration memory allocations:
  - reduced fragmentation
    - release in large chunks when job dies
    - can defrag at finer granularity
  - easier tracking
_______________________________________________________________________________

"Environments"
- Jobs can modify the environment that spawned child jobs live in.
  - eg: some jobs might manage memory-pool that children should allocate from
    - maybe this belongs at JobDescription level?  First prototype it there...

===============================================================================
== debugging support ==========================================================

Scan through jobs in pools.
- since we know where the jobs live, we can just walk through them linearly
- filter jobs
  - filter by job-description (use schwa::meta::TypeList)
  - or by decorations on Job/JobDescription
_______________________________________________________________________________

Job Decoration
- investigate how to use metaprogramming to decorate job
- example decorations:
  - age (birth time)
  - resource use
    - cpu and/or memory use
    - total, current, and/or statistical-historical
_______________________________________________________________________________

Instrumentation
- how often are jobs passed between workers?
  - measure both job-flow between Queues, and between JobPools
_______________________________________________________________________________

"Separate instances" of schwa::job
- Give debugger:
  - its own pools/queues/workers
  - UI that overlays/embeds rest of app
  - control over other Bosses
    - start/stop
    - if stopped, step individual workers as well as bookkeeper
_______________________________________________________________________________

User interface
- overlay or embed rest of app
- performance dashboard
- start/stop/step Workers
_______________________________________________________________________________

Optimizations
- use byte for ring index -> asset ring-size < 256
  - use metaprogramming to make this automatic, depending on ring size selected
