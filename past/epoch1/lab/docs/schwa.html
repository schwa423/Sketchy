Not every job makes it out of the lab.  job01 will, but maybe job02 will be purely exploratory, and job03 will be the next top-level version.  Nothing is allowed to depend on anything else inside the lab.  On the flip side, as a prerequisite for being promoted to the top-level, a module promises not to have any breaking changes made to it.

<h1> Welcome to ǝ </h1>


<h1> Code organization </h1>
<p>The ǝ source code is broken into modules, and organized such that multiple versions of the modules coexist side-by-side. The intention is that all versions of all libraries/tests/examples/apps can be compiled at any time, without resorting to time-travel via an external version control system, and without necessarily porting everything forward to the latest library version.</p>
